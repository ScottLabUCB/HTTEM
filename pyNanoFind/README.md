# pyNanoFind

This package provides the code to develop and use a convolutional neural network
for semantic segmentation of high resolution transmission electron microscopy
(HRTEM) micrographs. The provided network is for micrographs with size 512x512.

Example data preprocessing workflow is demonstrated in the notebook in "data
preprocessing" directory.

Setup for network training can be found in training files.

Example implmentation of the network can be found in results.

Bragg filtering provides a workflow to implement bragg peak filtering for a
comparison segmentation method.
